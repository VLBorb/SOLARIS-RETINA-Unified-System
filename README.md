# SOLARIS-RETINA-Unified-System
SOLARIS Unified System** is a computational simulation framework , designed to model conceptual photonic interactions and explore adaptive processes using a genetic algorithm. The system simulates how a "photonic output," generated based on parameters like wavelength and angle of incidence, can influence the evolution of an "adaptive retina."
